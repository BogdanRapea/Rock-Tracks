# Rock-Tracks

Description 
I followed the standard MVC - keeping data & functionality separate from the UI as much as possible.
The data is loaded in background so that it doesn’t  block the UI.
I relied  Navigation View Controllers .


Improvements
Custom classes for labels and buttons so that they are easily re-used.
If a larger number of views is expected to be added in the future I’d do the navigation programmatically.
